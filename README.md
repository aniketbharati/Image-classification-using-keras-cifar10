>This project uses keras for image classification on cifar10 dataset.

>The "class.py" is the program to be ran for the training and validation which further saves the model and the weights as "modelclass.json" and "modelclass.h5" respectively.

>The "predict.py" uses the saved model and saved weights to predict the class of a single image ,the name of the image can be edited directly edited in the code. 

>This repo also contains some test images for prediction purpose,please see the predict.pyto change the name of the test image to predict upon it.
